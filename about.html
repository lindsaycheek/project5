        <p>HTML is the unifying language of the World Wide Web. Using just the simple tags it contains, the human race has created an astoundingly diverse network of hyperlinked documents, from Amazon, eBay, and Wikipedia, to personal blogs and websites dedicated to cats that look like Hitler.

        <p>CSS isn’t easy. Combining a very permissive (somewhat broken) syntax with constantly evolving features and rendering inconsistencies makes CSS not that easy at all. Yes, the syntax is simple, but a simple syntax doesn’t make an easy language.

        <p>I am not content, nor should you be, at stopping once something just works, and not really knowing why. I gently challenge you to journey down that bumpy "road less traveled" and embrace all that JavaScript is and can do. With that knowledge, no technique, no framework, no popular buzzword acronym of the week, will be beyond your understanding.

        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>
          Ember Rising is a professional artist and entertainer based in Asheville, NC. Ember’s vibrant presence and unique style never fail to captivate an audience. Truly a natural born performer, her excitement is contagious. She specializes in fire dancing, hula hooping, LED spinning, art installations, and costume design.
          Ember started dance training at a very young age, focusing on modern and world styles. In 2011, she fell in love with hula hooping at a music festival, diving head first into prop manipulation. Continually pushing herself as a performer, she’s been practicing fire manipulation for over seven years now. When Ember isn’t entertaining audiences by playing with fire, she enjoys giving private lessons and creating one of a kind costumes.
          Ember Rising has graced stages across the country. Whether it’s a private party, music event, or arts festival, Ember is sure to create an experience to remember.
